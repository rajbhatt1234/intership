This is a simple React application that allows users to register, login, and manage their account details, including email, password, age, profession, and a profile image. The application uses React Router for navigation and localStorage for storing user data.

Features:
User Registration: Users can create an account with their email, password, age, and profession.
User Login: Users can log in using their email and password.
Account Page: Once logged in, users can view and update their account details, including their profile image, email, password, age, and profession.

Components Overview
App.js:

The main component that defines the routes and the structure of the app.
Routes available: /login, /register, /account, and a default / route that redirects to the login page.
Login.js:

Handles the login form.
Checks if the entered credentials match any registered user in localStorage.
If successful, the user is redirected to the account page.
Register.js:

Handles the user registration form.
Users can register by providing an email, password, age, and profession.
The registration data is saved in localStorage.
Account.js:

Displays and allows editing of the user’s account information, including email, password, age, profession, and profile image.
Updates the information in localStorage when the user clicks the "Update" button.
PrivateRoute.js:

A protected route wrapper that checks if the user is logged in before accessing the protected routes, such as the Account page.
If the user is not logged in, they are redirected to the login page.
How it Works
Registration: When a user registers, their details (email, password, age, and profession) are saved in localStorage as an array of users. This allows the application to persist user data across page reloads.

Login: When a user logs in, their entered email and password are compared against the stored users in localStorage. If a match is found, the user's data is saved as currentUser in localStorage, and they are redirected to the account page.

Account Page: On the account page, the user can view and update their personal information. Any updates are reflected in localStorage to persist the changes.

Redirects and Access Control:

If the user is not logged in and tries to visit a protected route (like /account), they will be redirected to the login page using React Router’s Navigate functionality.
If a user tries to access the app without being logged in, they will be prompted to log in first.
Features To Be Added
Profile Picture Upload: Add functionality to upload a profile picture and save it in localStorage.
Validation: Implement validation for inputs (email, password, etc.) to ensure better user experience.
Error Handling: Add error handling for various scenarios, such as incorrect login credentials or failed updates.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: For handling navigation and routing.
localStorage: To store user data on the client-side (passwords should ideally be hashed and stored securely in production).
CSS: For styling the app.
